## Current Conditions

New snowfall totals range from 8-14 inches above 8,000 feet. Recent southwest winds have loaded leeward terrain and formed touchy slabs in cross-loaded gullies.

## Travel Advice

- Stay off steep lee slopes and connected start zones.
- Watch for cracking, collapsing, and rapid warming.
- Practice conservative route finding and regroup in safe islands only.
