## Summary

A cold storm delivered 8-14 inches of low-density snow across upper elevation terrain over the last 48 hours. Strong west and southwest winds transported snow into north and east-facing start zones.

## Avalanche Problems

- **Wind Slab:** Most likely on leeward ridgelines and cross-loaded gullies.
- **Storm Slab:** Possible where soft new snow sits over old crust interfaces.

## Travel Advice

Use conservative route choices in terrain above treeline. Avoid committing to steep rollovers with recent drifted snow. Group spacing and communication remain essential.
